## AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

- AI: A field of computer science that aims to make computer achieve human-style intelligence.
- Machine Learning: A set of related techniques in which computeres are trained to perform a particular task rather than programming them.
- Deep Learning: A sub-field of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to perform a machine learning task.
- Realationship: AI <<< Machine Learning <<< Deep Learning 


## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

- Supervised: Providing labeled data
- Unsupervised: Providing  data without labels.

## Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

- Traditional Programming: 
	- Input,Rules -> Output
- Machine Learning: 
	- Input,Output -> Rules
